    "[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a software version control system that lets you keep track of computer source code and to collaborate with others in developing it.  [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a commercial web service built on top of git that makes it even easier for developers to collaborate on code.  You can think of it like this: git is to GitHub like R is to RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is by far the most commonly-used tool these days for collaborating on software.  The source code for [git itself](https://github.com/git/git) is managed on GitHub.  So is [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and [vowpal-wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit).  R uses a different software version control system called svn, but there is a mirror of its code on github [here](https://github.com/wch/r-source).\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with git, you'll first need to install it.  It can be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  While there are GUI applications for working with git (and RStudio itself has menu options for dealing with git), we'll be using the git commandline utility because it's clearer and more powerful.  It will work in an OS X terminal or the Windows command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So now, do the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Install a commandline version of git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n",
    "2.  Create a GitHub account for yourself, if you don't already have one.  Send an email to `mdagost@gmail.com` with the subject \"MScA GitHub\" and your username in the subject line.\n",
    "3.  Follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) to configure your username and email in git."
